Using raw data and consolidation on "stations" over the years
without interpolation or extrapolation or "cleansing"

Various Analysis functions:

- filter of data, optional with timeshift
- calculate aggregate criteria
- pivot-analysis
- regression-analysis
- cluster-analysis
- world-map
- leaflet and open street map

and lunar "months".
